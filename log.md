# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0 - Dec 9, 2023
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Going through the Odin Project. 20 percent done with the first course's content. Since I'm not working on a project I'll probably just do project Euler and find another coding challenge site to not have my skill degrade.

**Thoughts:** I love learning especially when there isn't a due date behind it
